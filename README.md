What is TF-IDF?
Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a widely used statistical method in natural language processing and information retrieval. It measures how important a term is within a document relative to a collection of documents (i.e., relative to a corpus).
Words within a text document are transformed into importance numbers by a text vectorization process. There are many different text vectorization scoring schemes, with TF-IDF being one of the most common.


As its name implies, TF-IDF vectorizes/scores a word by multiplying the wordâ€™s Term Frequency (TF) with the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).
Term Frequency: TF of a term or word is the number of times the term appears in a document compared to the total number of words in the document.

Inverse Document Frequency: IDF of a term reflects the proportion of documents in the corpus that contain the term. Words unique to a small percentage of documents (e.g., technical jargon terms) receive higher importance values than words common across all documents (e.g., a, the, and).

The TF-IDF of a term is calculated by multiplying TF and IDF scores.


TF-IDF=TF X IDF  

Translated into plain English, importance of a term is high when it occurs a lot in a given document and rarely in others. In short, commonality within a document measured by TF is balanced by rarity between documents measured by IDF. The resulting TF-IDF score reflects the importance of a term for a document in the corpus.
TF-IDF is useful in many natural language processing applications. For example, Search Engines use TF-IDF to rank the relevance of a document for a query. TF-IDF is also employed in text classification, text summarization, and topic modeling.
Note that there are some different approaches to calculating the IDF score. The base 10 logarithm is often used in the calculation. However, some libraries use a natural logarithm. In addition, one can be added to the denominator as follows in order to avoid division by zero.

Class MovieRecommender:

This class is designed to recommend movies based on their overviews (descriptions).
It uses the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique to measure the importance of words in the overviews.
Constructor (__init__ method):

Initializes the MovieRecommender instance with movie titles, overviews, and the number of keywords to consider (n_keywords).
Creates an instance of the TFIDF class (assuming it's defined elsewhere) and fits it to the provided movie overviews.
recommend method:

Takes an input movie overview (input_overview) and the number of recommendations to generate (n).
Calculates TF-IDF scores for the input overview and extracts the top keywords.
Compares the top keywords of the input overview with those of each movie in the dataset using Jaccard similarity.
Generates a list of tuples containing movie titles and their similarity scores.
Sorts the list based on similarity scores in descending order and returns the top n recommended movies.
Example Usage:

Loads a dataset of movies from a CSV file ('tmdb_5000_movies.csv').
Creates an instance of MovieRecommender (recommender_Movie) using movie titles, overviews, and a specified number of keywords (5 in this case).
Provides an example query for a movie overview from 1980 ("Galaxina is lifelike, voluptuous android").
Calls the recommend method to get recommendations based on the input overview and prints the results.
Uncommented Section:

There is an example section for querying movies released in 2010 or later. However, it's commented out. You can uncomment it and provide a query for testing.
In summary, the code defines a MovieRecommender class that uses TF-IDF to recommend movies based on their overviews, and it demonstrates the recommendation process with an example query.
